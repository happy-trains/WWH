# Unit Tests

## What
Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended.

## Why
A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy.

Unit testing finds problems early in the development cycle.

Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code or upgrade system libraries at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly.

## How
Unit testing frameworks

* [Junit](/junit5-jupiter-starter-gradle-kotlin/README.md)

Language-level unit testing support

* [Rust](/rust/README.md)
